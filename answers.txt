• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 

When committing your project to the GitHub repository, the.gitignore file instructs Git which files to ignore. Your repository's root directory contains gitignore.The.gitignore global file will be generated as a result. That file is now editable in the same manner as a local.gitignore file. The files and folders listed in the global.gitignore file will be disregarded by all of your Git repositories.

• Why should you have different branches? 

Using branches, you can securely experiment with new ideas, develop functionality, or address errors in a specific part of your repository. A branch is always made from an existing branch. Normally, you could build a new branch off of the repository's default branch.
